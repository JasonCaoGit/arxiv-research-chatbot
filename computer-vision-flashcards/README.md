# Computer Vision Transformer Flashcards

A flashcard application built with Next.js and React to help learn about state-of-the-art computer vision transformer architectures.

## Featured Research Papers

This application provides flashcards based on the following groundbreaking papers in computer vision:

1. **Vision Transformer (ViT)** - "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"
   - Applies transformer architecture directly to image patches
   - Demonstrates that CNNs are not necessary for strong computer vision performance

2. **Swin Transformer** - "Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows"
   - Introduces a hierarchical transformer with shifted windows for efficient computation
   - Creates multi-scale feature representation for computer vision tasks

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
